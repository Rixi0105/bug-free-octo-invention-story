The story is about five families lived in China in 1988. One of the  main character is a girl called DeShan. 
DeShan loved to play marbles. She played against all the kids in the neighborhood, and never lost a game. One day a new boy named Roy moved into town. Roy always wore a black bandana and claimed to be the best at marbles in the whole world.
Roy rattled on about beating the marble gangs of Greece. He claimed to have been the King of Marbles in the Northern Isles. DeShan listened to him rattling on and on and on and on. She just wanted to play marbles.
She told him that she only want to play marbles for fun but not for fames but Roy wouldn't listen. So DeShan left him, went back to where they were when they were both young, and pure.
